#### Overview
This is a 2D platformer created in Unity, which uses C#.

#### Player
The player will have a sword slash basic attack and move across the screen to destroy enemies.  The player will also be able to double jump and block attacks.

#### Enemies
We plan on having 2 or 3 enemy types, each with their own unique movement and attacks. If time allows, we will add a final boss. Defeating enemies will give the player either health or gold. Gold obtained by the player will acculumate as the player moves through the levels. 

#### Mana system
There is a mana system that allows the player to use a special ranged attack. Mana can be gained by destroying objects (such as crates) scattered around the level. 

#### Player Mode
We are planning on implementing only single-player.

## Resources

### Assets
We want the main focus to be on developing game mechanics and systems. Therefore, we plan on using free asset packs as much as possible and will only our own assets if needed. The following assets were used:

[Slime Mob](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/free-pixel-mob-113577) - sprites, animations, animation controller
[Hero Knight](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/characters/hero-knight-pixel-art-165188) - sprites, animations, animation controller
[Nature Pixel Art](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/2d/environments/nature-pixel-art-base-assets-free-151370) - props, tilemap
